## 2024-05-22 - Hidden Specs in Tests **Insight:** I discovered that the `tests/` directory contained verification scripts for features (`verify_quick_estimator.py`) that were not yet implemented in `dirking.html`. This effectively acted as a rigorous specification for the feature. **Strategy:** When looking for functional gaps or incomplete work, always audit the `tests/` folder first. It may contain "ghost specs" for high-value features that were planned but not built.
