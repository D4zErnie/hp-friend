## 2026-02-11 - Adding Quick Calculators for Engagement
Insight: Users are more likely to engage with an interactive tool (like a premium estimator) than a static "Contact Us" banner.
Strategy: Identify other "Call to Action" areas (e.g., Commercial Insurance) where a simple calculator (e.g., Revenue -> Liability Cost) could replace static text. The `QuickEstimator` pattern (Input -> Real-time Calc -> CTA) is highly reusable.
